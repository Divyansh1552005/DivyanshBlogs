# Google Dorks

## What are Google Dorks?

**Google Dorks** (also called **Google Hacking**) are advanced search queries that use special operators supported by Google Search to find specific, hidden, or sensitive information indexed on the web.

They leverage Google’s indexing power to narrow down results far beyond normal keyword searches.

**Google Dorks are not hacking by themselves. They only reveal information that is already publicly accessible but poorly protected.**

---

### Why Google Dorks Exist

Google indexes:

* Public websites
    
* Misconfigured servers
    
* Exposed files (PDFs, logs, backups)
    
* Open directories
    
* Error pages
    

Google Dorks help **security researchers**, **penetration testers**, **journalists**, and **developers** find such data efficiently.

---

## Real life Analogy

Think of Google as a **huge library**.

* Normal search → asking librarian casually
    
* Google Dorks → using catalog numbers, shelf IDs, and archive codes
    

You’re not breaking in, you’re just **searching smarter**.

---

### How Google Dorks Work

Google Search supports **advanced operators** like:

* `site:`
    
* `filetype:`
    
* `intitle:`
    
* `inurl:`
    
* `cache:`
    

These operators filter search results at the **indexing level**, not after results are shown.  
Let us take a look at them one by one.

---

## Core Google Dork Operators

### 1\. site:

Searches within a specific website or domain.

```text
site:example.com
```

**Use cases:**

* Find pages inside a company website
    
* Locate exposed admin panels
    

---

### 2\. filetype:

Searches for specific file extensions.

```text
filetype:pdf
filetype:xls
filetype:sql
```

**Use cases:**

* Find documents
    
* Locate database backups
    

---

### 3\. intitle:

Searches text inside the HTML `<title>` tag.

```text
intitle:"index of"
```

**Use cases:**

* Detect open directories
    
* Identify admin panels
    

---

### 4\. inurl:

Searches text inside the URL.

```text
inurl:admin
```

**Use cases:**

* Find login pages
    
* Discover configuration paths
    

---

### 5\. intext:

Searches inside visible page content.

```text
intext:"password"
```

**Use cases:**

* Find exposed credentials
    
* Locate debug messages
    

---

### 6\. cache:

Shows Google’s cached version of a page.

```text
cache:example.com
```

**Use cases:**

* View deleted pages
    
* Bypass temporary restrictions
    

---

### 7\. related:

Finds websites similar to a given domain.

```text
related:example.com
```

---

### 8\. allintitle / allinurl

Matches **all words** in title or URL.

```text
allintitle:login admin
allinurl:admin panel
```

---

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

Since while using the hacks mentioned above, you may come across some vunerabilities of some sites or any exploitable data, you need to understand the legal and ethical considerations.

What is **Allowed**:

* Educational research
    
* Bug bounty programs
    
* Security audits (with permission)
    

What is **Not allowed**:

* Unauthorized access
    
* Exploiting found data
    
* Downloading private information
    

> To conclude, Searching is legal, **misusing results is not**.

---

## Example

### Goal: Find publicly available PDF notes on Operating Systems

```text
filetype:pdf "operating system notes"
```

Google will return only PDFs containing that phrase.

---

# Google Search hacks

## Core Google Search Symbols

### 1\. Minus (-) Operator — Exclude Results

Removes unwanted words from search results.

```text
python tutorial -django
```

**Meaning:**

* Shows Python tutorials
    
* Excludes Django-related pages
    

**Use cases:**

* Filter noisy results
    
* Remove ads, brands, frameworks
    

---

### 2\. Plus (+) Operator — Force Inclusion

Earlier used to force exact match. Today it works logically when combined with quotes.

```text
"c programming" +arrays
```

**Meaning:**

* Must include both concepts
    

---

### 3\. Quotation Marks (" ") — Exact Match

Searches **exact phrase**, same word order.

```text
"operating system notes"
```

**Use cases:**

* Find copied text
    
* Plagiarism checks
    
* Error messages
    

---

### 4\. OR Operator — Logical OR

Search for **either** of the terms.

```text
linux OR unix
"data structures" OR "algorithms"
```

**Note that OR must be uppercase**

---

### 5\. Parentheses ( ) — Grouping Logic

Combine multiple operators logically.

```text
(site:edu OR site:ac.in) "machine learning"
```

**Meaning:**

* Searches ML content
    
* Only from `.edu` or `.`[`ac.in`](http://ac.in)
    

---

### 6\. Asterisk (\*) — Wildcard Operator

Acts as a **placeholder for unknown words**.

```text
"data * tree"
```

**Matches:**

* data binary tree
    
* data segment tree
    

## Smart Search Operators (Beyond Dorks)

### 7\. Define: — Instant Definitions

```text
define:throughput
```

---

### 8\. Range Operator (..) — Numeric Ranges

```text
laptop price 40000..60000
```

**Use cases:**

* Prices
    
* Years
    
* Versions
    

---

### 9\. Before / After — Time-based Search

```text
linux kernel after:2020
AI before:2018
```

---

### 10\. Related Search Trick

```text
related:github.com
```

Finds similar websites.

---

## Examples

### Force exact phrase + exclude junk

```text
"machine learning notes" filetype:pdf -blog -medium
```

---

### Combine grouping + site filtering

```text
(site:edu OR site:ac.in) "computer networks" filetype:ppt
```

---

### Wildcard‑based flexible search

```text
"data * tree" filetype:pdf
```

---

## Conclusion

By combining Google Dorks with advanced search operators, searching on Google becomes much smarter and more precise. These techniques help find exactly what you need whether it’s study notes, technical content, or solutions without wasting time on irrelevant results. Used properly, they make Google a powerful everyday research tool.
